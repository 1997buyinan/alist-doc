# load balancing

It is required that the file structures in the two accounts are exactly the same, and the program will automatically poll all accounts for download/request.

### how to use
One account can be added normally, and the other account can be added with the name of `the first account name + .balance + any other content`.

E.g:
- Account 1: `test`
- Account 2: `test.balance1`
- Account 3: `test.balance2`
- Account 4: `test.balance3`
- ...
- Account n: `test.balancen`
